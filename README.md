Hello There!👋

🚀 **About Me**

🎓 I am James Williams, a dual college student pursuing my Bachelor's degree in computer engineering and computer science at Georgia Southern University and also as a Ninja at the Coding Dojo. I have coded using **JavaScript, Java, C, C++, and Matlab** and I am currently learning **HTML and Python**. My end goal is to become a front-end developer or software engineer.

👨‍💻 I want to collaborate with other programmers on **Open Sorce** projects and I am enthusiastic about learning new languages, technology, and the like. I began my college career in 2016 as a graphic design major and changed my major to computer engineering in 2020 which is when I started learning **Matlab, Java, JavaScript, and C/C++**. This year, 2023, I was accepted into the Coding Dojo and will further my knowledge of the aforementioned compueter languages while also beginning to learn **HTML** and **Python** as well. I look forward to collaborating with other programmers on future projects in order to help each other grow as developers.

💥 Outside of the world of programming, I enjoy pushing myself to learn other skills such as playing various instruments, namely the barritone and trombone, filming videos, shooting photography, singing (badly), going to concerts and live wrestling events, hiking, cycling, canyoneering, and travelling. I love nature and am passionate about adventure and exploration. I have lived abroad in the Philippines for about two months and look forward to returning very soon. The last time I was there was in 2019. I have also travelled to Hong Kong, Guam, Jamaica, and Canada and plan on travelling a lot more in the future.

🎮 I love playing video games and I am a big fan of the horror and RPG/ adventure genres. My current favorite video game series' being God of War, The Legend of Zelda, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, the Sims, and Super Mario Bros. I have been playing video games since I was about two years old (shocking, right?) and would love to one day help code the games that I love to play!

💬 Feel free to ask me **Anything**. I am here to share my knowledge with anyone interested while also listening and learning new information from all of you.
